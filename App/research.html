Some past lessons learned regarding workflow is to make sure it makes sense. Developing an app requires quite a bit of research. You don't want to offend anyone. You have to think about different age groups, race, religions, and customs. As for design, you want to make sure app flows well. Colors should match up, things should make sense. You don't want something out of place. For example, you wouldn't place driving directions on a page to order food. For my app I could implement the use of the camera feature, geolocation, storage, and notification. People enjoy taking pictures of what they eat, I do it quite often myself. Geolocation can be used for restaurant locations. If friend lists are implemented, you can be notified when they are eating somewhere, making something new, and possible sharing an idea with you. Social networking has almost become a standard for apps to make it in the app world.
