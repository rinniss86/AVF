		One way I could change my HTML on my demo app to be more accessible, would be to make it more appealing. At the moment, I?m not to creative with HTML and CSS. I'm trying to find the extra time to really sit down and work at the appearance of my app.

Screen reader programs read everything on the screen, when you may only want some of the content on the screen.  Another thing is the text-to-speech functionality. It's so robotic sounding, and at times pronounces words incorrectly. Some of the accessibility functions on iOS are not so great. While turning some of them on, it changes the controls on my phone. I had to go in through iTunes just to turn it off. Wasn't easy to deal with, and became quite annoying.

Some of the features on iOS devices to support Accessibility would be Siri, dictation, and text-to-speech. Siri is an assistant feature that pretty much can control a good portion of your phone, with just the power of your voice. The problem with it, is some accents in peoples' voice makes it hard to get it working correctly. Same issue with the dictation feature.  On Android devices, one of the features is Talkback. Talkback uses synthesized speech to describe the results of actions, such as moving to a new control with the directional pad, or clicking a control, and events such as a notification or incoming call.

Two apps that are made for accessibility are Big Contacts-large font, which is made for those who have a hard time reading their contacts on their screen. And also Voice Brief, which is a personal assistant app that allows users to customize for news, the weather, calendar, and more.
